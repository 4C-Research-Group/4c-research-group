Being immersed in the realm of critical care over the span of 8 weeks allowed me to gain insight into how research is conducted at the bedside. It was evident that Dr. Ganesan, Maysaa, and the lab team strongly value mentorship, as they were always very supportive and available to provide my team and I with guidance on our research projects and in between observership sessions. I look forward to continue working on my research project with the 4C research group, and will carry forth my knowledge regarding pediatric care, and the environmental impact of anesthetics into my future career as a (hopefully pediatric) dentist!',
